# Sprint-4
This is my repository for Sprint 4 in DS4003

!!Please Note!! I'm still working through issues with nothing appearing on the graph when you choose a beverage that does not require milk.  

If you choose any drink that does require milk and choose a size and milk type, then you will see the graph change.

I spoke with Professor Kupperman about this today (4/3) and was told this was acceptable for the submission of Sprint 4.

We also discussed changing the bar graph to a circle bar graph on a later date. 

Here is the link to my render: https://sprint-4-again.onrender.com/
